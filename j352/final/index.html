        <p>Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, is one of the most listened to rappers of the past two decades. He also has
            consistently been one of the most controversial artists.</p>

        <p>Most people familiar with pop culture can remember this moment at MTV’s Video Music Awards when West
            infamously walked on stage and interrupted Taylor Swift's acceptance speech.</p>

        <p>Since then, West continues to spark controversy. Over the past few years, on a more concentrated basis, he
            has said and done things that have landed him in more than just controversy as he is now widely criticized
            for his behavior. </p>

        <h3 id="firsthead">Kanye’s growth as an artist and celebrity</h3>
        <p>West was born in Atlanta but spent most of his early life in Chicago. His popularity in music began with the
            release of his first studio album ‘College Dropout’ in 2004, which won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album
            in 2005. </p>

        <p> Since then, West has released 10 additional studio albums, won 24 Grammy’s and has been nominated for 75.
        </p>

        <img class="img-fluid" src="site/images/timeline2.png">


        <p> In the 2000’s and early 2010’s, West was mainly known for his music. However, his fame expanded during the
            mid 2010’s.</p>

        <p>He was famously married to fellow celebrity Kim Kardashian, who he has four children with. They recently
            split in 2021.</p>

        <p> West also gained fame for the brand ‘Yeezy’ that he developed in partnership with Adidas. The sneakers and
            other footwear designed by this brand became some of the most popular shoes on the market and continue to
            have high resale prices. </p>

        <p>Despite the successes in West’s career and personal life, many of these things fell apart in recent years as
            he became more known for controversy. </p>

        <h3>Does Kanye’s popularity and accomplishments as a rapper overcome his recent controversies?</h3>

        <p>West turned heads in 2018 after an interview with TMZ when he made claims saying than slavery was a choice.
        </p>

        <p>“You hear about slavery for 400 years. 400 years? That sounds like a choice,” he said. “Like, that was there
            for 400 years and it’s all of y'all? It’s, like, we’re mentally in a prison. I like the word ‘prison’
            because slavery is too direct to the idea of Blacks.”
        </p>

        <p>West was scrutinized for this and it was nearly three months later when he apologized for the hurt these
            words caused.
        </p>

        <p>Only a couple of months after West’s comment about slavery, he was again found under the spotlight of
            controversy after he publicly showed his support for former president, Donald Trump.
        </p>

        <p>West met with Trump in the Oval Office in October of the same year wearing a ‘Make America Great Again Hat’,
            which angered many.
        </p>

        <p>Amidst the controversy, West released his album ‘Ye’ that June and it reached #1 on the Billboard.
        </p>

        <p>Despite the album’s popularity, when looking at Google analytics of when people searched “Kanye West”, West
            was searched significantly more during the week of his comment on TMZ and the week when he met with Trump in
            the oval office.

        </script>

        <p>Between 2019 and this year, the extent of West’s controversy was around his presidential candidacy. </p>

        <p>His candidacy itself spurred discussion, however it wasn’t until a campaign rally he had that people became
            upset with him.
        </p>

        <p>During this rally he revealed personal information about Kardashian and a considered abortion while pregnant
            with their first born. He also made false claims about Harriet Tubman.
        </p>

        <p>“Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go work for other white people,"
            West said.
        </p>

        <p>While he received backlash for these things, the events that came in 2022 increased in frequency and in the
            attention they received.

        <h3>2022 so far… </h3>

        <p>After the February release of West’s album ‘Donda 2’, over the following couple of months West filled his
            Instagram feed with posts ranting about fellow celebrities. A lot of this was targeted at his ex-wife
            Kardashian and her at-the-time boyfriend, Pete Davidson, who West nicknamed ‘Skete’.
        </p>

        <img id="timeline" src="site/images/timeline1.png">
        <br>

        <p>In his music video for the song ‘Eazy’, West went as far as to decapitate and carry around a claymation head
            of Davidson.
        </p>


        <p>While West’s odd and sometimes aggressive posts on social media brought attention his way, in October, West
            received more public scrutiny than he has probably ever gotten before.
        </p>



        <p>On October 3 West arrived at Paris Fashion Week wearing a shirt reading ‘White Lives Matter’. The phrase has
            been used by those in opposition with the Black Lives Matter movement.
        </p>

        <p>Less than a week later he expressed extreme anti-semetic sentiments and tweeted that he was "going death con
            3 on Jewish people." This was followed with other anti-semetic remarks throughout the month.
        </p>



        <p>In the next week West sparked even more controversy after falsely claiming on the podcast “Drink Champs” that
            George Floyd’s death, which sparked mass Black Lives Matter protests around the country, was due to a drug
            overdose on fentanyl.
        </p>

        <p>After a month of garnering negative attention from the press and the country, Adidas dropped its partnership
            with West and the ‘Yeezy’ brand after over seven years.
        </p>

        </script>


        <p id="last-p">Whether West’s behavior over the past few months will be enough to have people stop listening to
            his music and have him ‘canceled’ is still left to be answered. However, as he continues to do increasingly
            reprehensible things, we may soon find out.
