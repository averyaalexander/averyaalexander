    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pounds pork shoulder, trimmed and cut into thin 2x1-inch slices</li>
            <li>1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic chili paste
            </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, grated</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 bunch green scallions, white and green parts thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon toasted white sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim the pork, slice and place in a medium size mixing bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a second small mixing bowl add the soy sauce, sesame oil, chili paste, brown sugar, garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix well to blend.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add the marinate to the sliced pork and toss to coat. Place the pork and marinade in a large ziplock bag and marinate for at least 8 hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>To finish the bulgogi, place a large cast iron skillet over high heat. When hot, but not smoking, a place a layer of pork in the skillet without overcrowding. Sear the pork until you begin to see nice coloration/caramelization, about 2-3 minutes. Using tongs, carefully turn the pork over and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. Transfer the bulgogi to a plate and cover to keep warm. Repeat the above process with the remaining pork, discarding the remaining marinade.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To serve, place in a large serving bowl (with or without rice), sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and scallions.
            </li>
        </ol>
