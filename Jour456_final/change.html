        <p>Magazines started being distributed in the U.S. in the mid-1700s, however none of them lasted long because they were unaffordable and difficult to distribute across large regions. Even in the early 1800s when magazines became more common, the majority were either political or literary magazines<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#changecite1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>Magazines in the early 19th century were geared towards the upper-class and were for the most part elitist. In most cases, they made barely any profit because the only way the magazines brought in revenue was through subscription fees<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#changecite1">[2]</a></sup>.  </p>

        <p>The heights in circulation that later magazines were able to reach were seemingly impossible to attain during this time since postage costs and low profit kept the magazines contained to a local radius. </p>

        <p>During the mid-1800s, magazines started slowly shifting away from elitism and were able to take a stronger hold in society. Production became simplified and the magazine industry reflected changes in society as it transitioned to being more industrialized and urbanized<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#changecite1">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>However, the largest industry changes came after the Civil War. Up to this point, most magazines were still not utilizing advertisements so the publishers, who were not making much money, still were mostly writing and publishing for enjoyment.</p>

        <p>The period after the war saw an incredible amount of growth for magazines both in regards to circulation and variety. In 1865 after the Civil War, there were only about 700 magazines in circulation, but in the following 20 years, that number grew to 3,300<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#changecite1">[4]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>One of the primary reasons for this was the Second Class Postage Act of 1879<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#changecite1">[5]</a></sup>. This act gave magazines a cheaper postage cost and more magazines were able to expand their circulation out of their local area.</p>

        <p>Although postage costs played a significant factor in allowing magazines to reach a broader audience, the growth in circulation would not be nearly as high if it weren't for the changes in accessibility across socio-economic groups, genders and races. </p>

        <p>Magazines across subject areas started incorporating illustrations and other visual components in their pages which were accessible to populations who were not literate or highly educated. As magazines brought in advertisements, they could also lower the price of their publication, allowing lower-income people to enjoy them<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#changecite1">[6]</a></sup>. </p>

        <p>Most importantly for the genre of fashion magazines, all of these changes created more room and demand for magazines geared towards women to be produced. The rise in production of women’s magazines makes even more sense since women made up the majority of magazine subscribers<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#changecite1">[7]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>Fashion magazines and other magazines targeted towards women quickly became some of the most popular magazines of this era. This is seen in both the context of Godey’s Lady’s Book and Harper’s Bazaar, which are talked about in the <a class="namemention" href="mags.html">“Notable Magazines”</a> section of this website. Explore this website to see how these changes in the landscape of magazines helped foster more female representation in journalism, both as subjects and journalists. </p>
