    <p>Popular fashion magazines like Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Cosmopolitan are staples in the realm of fashion journalism today. But these magazines, and many others, formed their roots as far back as the 1800s when the genre was just beginning in the United States. Although there are many fashion magazines in publication today, the early fashion magazines were trailblazers for the genre and, even then, were some of the most popular magazines out there.</p>

    <p>When these early fashion magazines were founded in the United States, they were not the first of their kind. The majority of fashion magazines and literature started in the fashion capital of the world, Paris.</p>
        
    <p>Even in the 1700-1800s, Paris fashion was a model for the rest of the world, and many European countries looked to them as a guide. The first ever fashion magazine released in 1785 in France, Le Cabinet des Modes, was imitated by multiple surrounding European countries<sup  class="reference">
        <a href="#homecite1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
        
    <p>Towards the 19th century, the status of French fashion grew and Europeans and Americans became even more enamored by it. During this period, it was common for French Magazines to circulate around these countries<sup  class="reference">
        <a href="#homecite1">[2]</a></sup>.</p> 
        
    <p>It was later on, in the 1830s, when the first fashion magazine was developed in America.</p> 
        
    <p>The landscape of the 1800s gave room for extreme growth in the magazine industry and allowed for new genres of journalism to emerge. In the case of fashion journalism, literacy amongst women played a large role in popularizing the genre. Then, looking at this alongside lower postage rates and financial gains through advertisements, the perfect landscape was created for the genre to emerge.</p>
        
    <p>Once fashion magazines in the U.S. started popping up more frequently in the late 1800s, the genre was solidified into society.</p>
        
    <p>Although America was producing its own fashion magazines, the fashions inside were still modeled after Parisian fashion and this did not change until later on when an American sense of fashion was established.</p>
        
    <p>This genre meant much more than just fashion though. It created a place for more women to get involved in journalism. Some of the first and most successful women editors of magazines were the editors of fashion magazines.</p>
        
    <p>With more women at the top of the newsroom hierarchy, there were also more opportunities for other women to venture into journalism.</p> 
        
    <p>This genre gave women readers a forum where they could read about topics and issues that are specifically affecting them. Though every one differed, the female editors of the magazines would ingrain their views within the magazines, especially if they concerned the rights of women.</p> 
        
    <p>Please see the rest of this website if you are interested in learning more about how this genre emerged and about some important early magazines and their editors. </p>
