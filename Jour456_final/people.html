        <p>Prior to her career at <a class="namemention" href="mags.html">Godey's Lady's Book</a>, Hale did not intend on being a magazine editor. She was much more educated than a woman would have typically been during this time and was a skillful writer<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#edcite1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>However it was not until she was 40 years old and her husband passed away, leaving her to care for her five children, that writing became her career<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#edcite2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
            
        <p>Writing became her life's work and she published several successful poetry books and novels in the early 1820s. Her poetry specifically caught the attention of publishers in New York and Boston, which led to Reverend John L. Blake to ask her to move to Boston to become the editor of Ladies’ Magazine in 1828<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#edcite2">[3]</a></sup>.</p>.
        <p>Eventually in 1837, when her magazine and Lady’s Book merged, she became the editor of Godey’s Lady’s Book<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#edcite2">[4]</a></sup>.</p>.
            
        <p>While she ran Godey’s, Hale was determined to publish as many quality women writers as possible<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#edcite3">[5]</a></sup>.</p>
            
        <p id="quote">“The wish to promote the reputation of my own sex and of my country were among the earliest mental emotions I can recollect.” – Sarah Josepha Hale<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#edcite2">[6]</a></sup></p> 
            
        <p>Throughout her writings in the magazine, she crusaded for the education of women and encouraged them to seek professions outside of the home<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#edcite3">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
        
        <p>Despite this, she still had pretty conservative views of what a woman's role in society should be<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#edcite2">[8][9]</a></sup>. </p>
            
        <p>She believed that the woman's primary role was in the house and that it was her responsibility to be the moral head of the family. This belief was also reflected in terms of what jobs she saw to be appropriate for women and she frowned upon women who entered into jobs that were better suited for men, such as politics<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#edcite2">[10]</a></sup>. </p>
            
        <p>Even though in today’s times Hale’s views are generally frowned upon by scholars, it is important to note that these views were still fairly radical for the time and that her complex attitudes about the woman's place in society resembled the divided views in society at this time<sup  class="reference">

        <p>Mary Booth was a very well known historian and translator and had some experience in journalism prior to being brought on as the editor of <a class="namemention" href="mags.html#harpbaz">Harper’s Bazaar</a> by Fletcher Harper<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#edcite2">[12]</a></sup>. </p>

        <p>Her philosophy while publishing the magazine was to give the reader what she wants, and through that philosophy she was able to lead the magazine into success<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#edcite5">[13]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>As a well-known suffragist, Booth used her magazine to encourage women to reach for things outside of the domestic sphere. Because of her outwardness about this topic, she became a role model and celebrity among women<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#edcite5">[14]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>She edited Harper’s Bazaar for over 20 years before she passed away and was succeeded by Margerat Sangster. Booth’s successes in the magazine were not left behind and even after her passing, Sangster kept the format Booth constructed for the magazine mostly the same<sup  class="reference">
            <a href="#edcite2">[15]</a></sup>.

    <h3 class="magheaders" id="julia">Julia Ringwood Coston</h3>

    <p>Julia Ringwood Coston was the founder and the editor of <a class="namemention" href="mags.html#ringwoods">Ringwood's Afro-American Journal of Fashion</a> and was one of the first African-American women to be an editor of a publication. She was originally born in Virginia and was enslaved as a child prior to slavery being abolished<sup  class="reference">
        <a href="#edcite6">[16]</a></sup>.</p> 

    <p>Her father was the owner of the plantation she was born on and her identity as a biracial woman influenced a lot of the content she included in her magazine<sup  class="reference">
        <a href="#edcite6">[17]</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>After the civil war, she and her family left their plantation and moved to Washington D.C.. Dropping out of school at 13, she was her family's primary breadwinner and went to work as a governess in the home of an army general<sup  class="reference">
        <a href="#edcite6">[18]</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Later in her life, she married W. H. Coston, who was an author and graduate from Yale, and had two children<sup  class="reference">
        <a href="#edcite6">[19]</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>She chose to use her maiden name “Ringwood” in the title as opposed to her husband's last name Coston because of the risk she saw publishing this magazine posed towards him and his career. The choice of using the term ”Afro-American” was also an intentional one by Coston. During this period there was a movement towards using this term to refer to people of African descent because they believed it was more inclusive than other terms used at the time<sup  class="reference">
        <a href="#edcite6">[20]</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>She created Ringwood’s to serve African-American women in a way other magazines were neglecting to do. As an avid supporter of other women writers, she wanted to use this platform to encourage young women to gain writing and publication experience. She also believed that by supporting these writers, she was also providing the journal's target audience with good role models<sup  class="reference">
        <a href="#edcite7">[21]</a></sup>.</p>

   <p>Despite her accomplishments, there is very little recorded about Julia Ringwood Coston and her life and much of the information collected about her is from short biographies about her during her time and from what she wrote in her magazine.</p>
