        </figure>

        <p>Godey’s Lady’s Book is regarded as the first magazine to really focus on the topic of fashion. However, this
            magazine was not as fashion oriented as some later ones because of editing differences between the
            editor, <a class="namemention" href="people.html#sarah">Sarah Josepha Hale</a>, and the owner of the
            magazine, Louis Godey<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>Godey’s started as a merger between two publications. The first of these publications was Ladies’ Magazine,
            which was edited by Hale<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite1">[2]</a></sup>. However in 1837, Louis Godey bought Hale’s magazine and merged it
            with his own Lady’s Book. When Godey bought the magazine, he brought on Hale as the editor and thus began
            her career for Godey’s Lady’s Book<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite1">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>Despite her role at the magazine and her contribution towards its future successes, Godey only would give her the title of “Literary editor” even though she was second only to him in the hierarchy of the magazine<sup class="reference"> <a href="#magcite2">[4]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>Before Hale came to the magazine, Lady’s Book rarely published original content because there were not copy-right laws at the time. This practice changed once she began as editor, allowing the magazine to reach new
            heights in popularity and become the most popular women’s magazine in the mid-19th century<sup
                class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite1">[5]</a></sup>.</p>


        <p>Under Hale’s leadership, Godey’s Lady’s Book became an 84-page monthly magazine by the 1850s and reached a
            circulation of 150,000 right before the beginning of the Civil War<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[6]</a></sup>. </p>

        <p>Like many magazines at the time, Godey’s Lady’s Book was geared towards upper-class women<sup
                class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[7]</a></sup>. It mostly published literature and poetry in its beginnings and Hale
            set strict guidelines for what content could be included.</p>

        <p>Hale wanted the literature in the magazine to be moral and pure, which eventually led to the publication's
            downfall during the Civil War because she did not believe talk about an ongoing war met these criteria<sup
                class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite1">[8]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>Besides literature and poetry, Godey’s Lady’s Book included topics like recipes, handicrafts, patterns,
            beauty, gardening, interior decoration, musical scores, fashion plates and fashion chit-chat<sup
                class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite3">[9]</a></sup>. However, the fashion plates found dispersed in the pages of the
            magazine were by far the most popular feature.</p>

        <p>These fashion plates would typically feature the latest styles from Paris and offered a diverse selection of
            models for women to imitate. Many women would even rip these plates out of the magazine to use as home-decor<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite3">[10]</a></sup>.</p>
        <figure id="fashionplate">

                    <a href="#magcite3">[Fig. 2]</a></sup> </figurecaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The fashion plates included in the magazine were typically created by wood carvings and then hand colored in
            Philadelphia at the magazine's plant or by women artists working from home. However, the women who would color these
            fashion plates were typically unsupervised, which led to discrepancies in the colors of the dresses.
            Some readers would be confused when they would compare their plates to their friends who had different
            colors included<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[11]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>Even though the fashion plates helped the magazine gain traction, Hale adamantly despised the inclusion of
            them. She considered the fashions to be frivolous and preferred that domestic talent be promoted in
            order to help display a more American sense of style<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[12]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>During the Civil War, subscription for Godey’s steeply dropped and the publication was out run by cheaper
            publications that were released in the latter part of the century. </p>

        <h3 class="magheaders" id="harpbaz">Harper's Bazaar (1867-present)
        </h3>

        <p>Harper’s Bazaar, which originally was spelled “Bazar” until 1929, is regarded as the first fashion magazine
            in the sense that it is purely devoted to fashion<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[13]</a></sup>. Rather than being targeted towards the mass market, like Godey’s Lady’s
            book was, it was specifically tailored to those who cared about fashion<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite1">[14]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p> When Harper’s Bazaar was first released in 1867, the market for women’s magazines was still largely untapped
            despite women making up the majority of magazine subscribers. Women wanted more options for magazines that
            were tailored to them and Harper’s Bazaar delivered<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite1">[15]</a></sup>. </p>


        <p> Harper’s Bazaar was founded by Harper & Brother, and they originally brought on <a class="namemention"
                href="people.html#mary">Mary Booth</a> to be their editor until she passed away in 1889<sup
                class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite4">[16]</a></sup>. In the first edition, the magazine described itself as “A Repository
            of Fashion, Pleasure, and Instruction”<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite3">[17]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>In the first 10 years after publication, the magazine reached an impressive circulation of 80,000 and only
            continued to grow in popularity afterwards. For decades after its original release, Harper’s Bazaar was
            considered the biggest and most successful fashion magazine<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[18][19]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>The magazine was originally inspired by the German magazine, Der Bazar, which is where Fletcher Harper also
            got the name for the magazine from. </p>

        <p>Aimed at upper-middle class women, the magazine expressed preferences towards more luxurious things and
            fashions<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[20]</a></sup>. The pictures of the latest fashions typically came from etchings
            delivered from Der Bazar to New York, where Harper’s Bazaar was published. These fashion plates usually
            were large and would sometimes even span across multiple pages in the magazine<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[21]</a></sup>. </p>

        <p> Mary Booth would also include etchings and carvings by well known artists and cartoonists like Winslow Homer
            and Thomas Nast<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[22]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>At this point, the majority of the fashions displayed were still coming from Paris and Berlin,
            however they were sometimes modified to better fit the U.S. market. As the magazine gained more traction,
            Booth also had her staff make reports on the latest fashions in New York<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[23]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>While the majority of the magazine was dedicated to fashion, Booth also included things like short stories,
            poems, articles about manners, health, furniture and household management. There were also sections
            dedicated to gossip and humor<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[24]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>Even today, Harper’s Bazaar remains one of the most popular fashion magazines in the market and its early
            entrance into the market was extremely important towards its future successes.</p>


        <h3 class="magheaders" id="ringwoods">Ringwood's Afro-American Journal of Fashion (1891-1895) </h3>
        <hr>

        <figure id="ringwoodcover">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="images/ringwoods_cover.png">
            <figurecaption>Cover of Ringwood's Afro-American Journal of Fashion, 1893<sup class="reference">

        <p><cite>Ringwood's Afro-American Journal of Fashion</cite> was a fashion magazine geared towards
            African-American women in the late 1800s. Not only was it the first fashion magazine for African-American
            women, but it was also the first popular magazine aimed towards this group<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[25]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>The magazine ranged from 12-16 pages long and showcased some of the latest Parisian fashions and sketches of
            prominent Black women. It also included things like dressmaking patterns, articles about health, poetry and
            love stories. In its prime, the magazine reached a circulation of about 4,000 copies per month<sup
                class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[26]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>Ringwood’s was founded by <a class="namemention" href="people.html#julia">Julia Ringwood Coston</a> in 1891
            in Cleveland, Ohio and was distributed throughout the United States and the Caribbean<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[27]</a></sup>. She saw a gap in what white magazines were covering and created the
            Ringwood's so that the interests of Black women could be represented in a magazine<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[28]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>The magazine would display  pictures, articles, obituaries, and biographical sketches of
            African-American women who Coston found to be outstanding members of the community. She thought that it was
            important to represent these elite women as modelhoods of ladyhood and to show that despite society's
            assumptions, African-American women could be and are ladylike<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[29]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>Coston found fashion to be the perfect way to help combat the negative assumptions about Black women during
            this period and thought it could also help uplift the whole community regardless of class.</p>

        <p>However, when showing images of fashion and fashionable women, the magazine typically portrayed white
            women<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[30]</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>Still, the magazine offered a forum where race was connected to fashion and allowed working class
            African-American women to see role models from their community.</p>

        <p>While much of the information about Ringwood’s was lost to history, the importance that the magazine had
            towards Black women during this period is not. Ringwood’s had supporters across the country and readers
            enjoyed both the writings and drawings included within it<sup class="reference">
                <a href="#magcite2">[31]</a></sup>.</p>
